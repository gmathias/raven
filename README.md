# Raven

Developer-friendly Build

## Why?

Because Maven sucks. And Gradle is too freestyle, too magic.

## Maven: the good, the bad and the ugly

### The good
- structured

### The bad
- lack of basic features:
  - no decent junit report

### The ugly
- XML hell
- error reporting is messy, drown in verbose logs

## The plan

### Adoption: Maven compatibility

Raven would generate POM in order to let people build via Maven?
